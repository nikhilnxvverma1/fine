# File Neat

### Disk usage + File organization

We all go through it. Messy folder structures, low disk spaces, unrecognizable filenames, yet we still procrastinate the task of cleaning it all up.

**FI.NE** is a clean disk utility tool that allows you to analyze your disk usage. It then goes one step further by providing a handy file browser that can be used to perform a multitude of file operations.

After scanning a directory, you get a **sunburst** chart that gives you an overview of the root folder's disk usage. Think of a sunburst chart as a pie chart. Except that it provides several layers to display a hierarchy.

Colored elements represent folders that can be clicked to zoom and show further details. Hovering over any element reveals further information about that element.Files and folders that are too small are intentionally omitted out for the sake of brevity.

Once you have found a directory you would like to work with, just hit **_Organize_**. This takes you to the file browser that can be used to perform several operations on a group of selected items. No need to perform operations out of the application and rescan the directory again. FI.NE provides everything you need under one roof. Clicking the **_Analyze_** button at the bottom right takes you back to the sunburst chart.

### Instructions for running:
